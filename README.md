# AdEnA
This repository contains a Matlab and a Python implementation of the Advanced Enclosure Algorithm to solve multi-objective optimization problems.

## Getting Started
You can start using AdEnA by downloading or cloning this repository using the green button near the top of the [GitHub page](https://github.com/LeoWarnow/AdEnA).
Then, just open the [UserFile.m](https://github.com/LeoWarnow/AdEnA/blob/main/matlab/UserFile.m) to access the Matlab implementation or the [UserFile.ipynb](https://github.com/LeoWarnow/AdEnA/blob/main/python/UserFile.ipynb) for a Jupyter Notebook to access the Python implementation.
Both serve as an interface to AdEnA and provide all instructions that you need to get started.

## References
