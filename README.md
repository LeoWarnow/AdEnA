# AdEnA
This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the Advanced Enclosure Algorithm to solve multi-objective optimization problems.

## Getting Started
You can start using AdEnA by downloading or cloning this repository using the green button near the top of the [GitHub page](https://github.com/LeoWarnow/AdEnA).
Then, just open the [UserFile.m](https://github.com/LeoWarnow/AdEnA/blob/main/UserFile.m).
It serves as an interface to AdEnA and provides all instructions that you need to get started.

## References
